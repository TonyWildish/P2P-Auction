bidding strategy with funny-money? Players will want to conserve budget if they are sharing the budget over multiple links, but not if they're bidding on a single link.

So, how about this for the single-link case:
1) bidders always bid their full budget for their target as a first bid
2) when they get an allocation, if it's equal to their target, they stop
3) if not,
 3a) if the price/unit is higher than they bid, they bid as much as they can at the price they're offered
 3b) if it's less than their bid price (can that happen?) they drop their bid and raise their price. But by how much?

If they're bidding on multiple links they should apply this process to each link, which gives them a (q,p) vector for the links. Then, take links with higher q and shave their budget, allocating it to the links with lower q. It's essentially applying the same PSP algorithm to their own bidding strategy!
